An end-to-end machine learning project to predict the rent of houses in and around Lagos State, South West, Nigeria.
The data was web scraped, cleaned, munched and structured with Pandas, visualized with Matplotlib and used to train a linear regression model.
HTML and CSS were used to create the front end while JavaScript and Flask were used to build the server.
The project is deployed on [lagHP](https://laghp.onrender.com/).
